Starting most of the time with counts of categorical columns

Looking only a continental US plus Disctrict of Columbia (Washington) 


```{r}

us_wind %>% 
    # FALSE comes before TRUE (in this case Other is on top)
    # fct_lumped data needs to be arranged so that TRUE comes on the top of the table
    mutate(p_name = fct_lump(p_name, 6)) %>% 
    arrange(p_name != "Other") %>% 
    filter(xlong < 100) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(xlong, ylat, color = p_name)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() + 
    coord_map() +
    theme_void()
```

```{r}
# one dot for every individual project
# in da HOUSE!
wind_projects %>% 
    ggplot(aes(lon, lat, size = turbines, color = year)) +
    borders("state") +
    geom_point() +

```

19:00

```{r}
us_wind %>% 
    distinct(p_name, p_year) %>% 
    count(p_name,sort = TRUE)

wind_projects %>% 
    ggplot(aes(year)) +

```

26:00 How did total capacity changed over time?

```{r}
wind_projects %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(year, total_capacity)) +
    geom_point()

wind_projects %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    # if all of the capacity is divided under all turbines
    # you get the capacity for one turbine
    # how this changed over time
    ggplot(aes(year, total_capacity / turbines)) +
    geom_point()

wind_projects %>% 
    group_by(year) %>%
    # does not make sense
    ggplot(aes(year, turbines / total_capacity)) +
    geom_point()
```

39:00

```{r}
us_wind %>% 
    group_by(t_model) %>% 
    summarise_at(vars())
```
